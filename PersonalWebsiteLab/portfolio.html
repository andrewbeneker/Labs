        <p>
            Though just getting started in his developer career, Andy has already created some interesting and
            noteworthy applications! Though the fun is just beginning for him, we also hope it will also be just
            beginning for you as well. It's how all great journeys... um... hmmm... whats the word?... yes, of course!
            it's how they start.

        <h3>Library Terminal</h3>

        <p>
            The first group project completed at Grand Circus. Overall, quite a success but not without it's challenges,
            Andy and his group put together a C# application for the ages. Get ready to do some virtual browsing!

        <h3>Roshambo!</h3>

        <p>
            Also colloquially known as "rock, paper, scissors," Andy created this application relatively early on in his
            tenure at Grand Circus. The application allows the user to choose from several opponents and keep score
            against the onslaught of randomly generated moves. Prepare to Roshambo!

        <h3>Circles</h3>

        <p>
            This simple application is being included for lack of other complete applications on his (currently) sparse
            GitHub account. It's an application that provides information on the nature of a circle when given the radius.
            Circle lovers beware!

        <h3>Personal Website</h3>

        <p>
            Originally an exercise to explore the fundamentals of HTML and CSS, Andy somehow found a way 
            to make the most interesting website ever created. That is, if you're interested in who Andy is.
            If you don't care about that, this website is the worst.
