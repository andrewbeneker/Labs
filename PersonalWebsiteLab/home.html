        <p> Welcome to the wide world of Andy Beneker. Sorry in advance! <br>
            Get ready to learn everything there is to know about him. You'll <br>
            laugh, you'll cry, you'll wonder: "why the hell am I reading this?" <br>

            After working in tech to help develop customer service experience and UX, Andy has made the leap to
            learn coding and become a C#/.NET developer via the Grand Circus Bootcamp. Critics have described
            this move as "exhilirating and inconceivable," to which Andy has replied, "...you keep on using this word...
            
            I do not think it means what you think it means." Graduation is anticipated in April and Andy looks
            greatly forward to a new life in the developer world.

            Andy has always had an aptitude for music, every since he was a child. Although he had to be forced to learn
            as a child, his principal instrument is the piano/keyboard. Andy has employed these skills in a variety of
            ways, playing piano and organ in a blues/funk group, while also creating varied, eclectic electronica on his own.
            Andy has recently ventured into the world of sound therapy, playing more ethereal instruments, likesinging
            bowls, to create soothing soundscapes meant to transport the listener to new vistas within their own consciousness.

            Though only father to two cats presently, Marvin and Elvira, Andy was previously father to three
            wonderful cats, including Archibald. Archibald has been described frequently as "the best cat who has ever lived."
            He was always up for snuggles, pets and wanted to be everyone's friend. He passed away in October 2024 and we all miss him very much. Experts report that the world has not been the same without him.

        <p>
            Andy grew up in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan and spent his entire childhood there. Shortly after high school
            he moved to East Lansing to attend college at Michigan State University and pursue a part-time career in
            DJing. Following college, Andy made the decision to leave Michigan altogether for the purple-mountain-
            majesty of Boulder, Colorado. Andy resided there for ten years, taking in the sights, hearing the
            sounds, and doing all the do-ey things that a person living in the mountains does. It was exhausting. Following
            the tenure in Colorado, Andy finally moved home to Michigan in 2023 to be closer to family again and to
            escape the ever-escalating cost of living in Colorado. What a journey!
